# Progress

Last updated: 2026-07-12

## Current status

Phase 0 through Phase 3 are complete. Phase 4 Offline controls are next.

## Locked decisions

- Minecraft, Paper, and Fabric target: 1.21.11.
- Paper API: 1.21.11-R0.1-SNAPSHOT.
- Java toolchain: 21.
- Runtime: Node.js 22 and TypeScript.
- Runtime-Paper protocol: 1.0.
- Runtime and Paper will have separate authoritative stores; they will never
  share-write one SQLite file.
- Every Runtime-Paper envelope has `messageId`, `requestId`, timestamp, and
  nonce. `requestId` is required even for standalone control/health exchanges.
- `DEGRADED` is a health dimension, not an additional operational state.
- Build-preview chunks are framing data inside the protocol 1.0 preview schema;
  semantic validation treats reassembly as a separate validation layer.
- The optional Fabric client must load without Litematica or MaLiLib.
- Gradle and npm work is run serially on this constrained host.
- Phase 2 uses an injectable fake provider adapter for readiness tests. Production
  provider network calls remain fail closed until request state, policy, and
  request binding are testable.
- Phase 3 uses `paper.hello` followed by `runtime.hello`; the Runtime echoes
  Paper's challenge and selects exact protocol `1.0`. Both sides enforce the
  shared HMAC golden transcript and a cross-connection replay window.
- `/agent` is absent from `paper-plugin.yml` and is registered through Paper's
  public `CommandMap` only after every core check succeeds. An initial failure
  requires an external fix and server restart; Phase 4 `/agent on` cannot recover
  a command that was never registered.

## Phase 0: repository scaffold

Completed:

- [x] Root Gradle build, locked version catalog, and constrained worker/memory
      settings are complete and verified.
- [x] Paper Java 21 scaffold builds a descriptor-valid JAR. A live Paper server
      launch is intentionally outside the headless Phase 0 verification lane.
- [x] Runtime Node.js 22/TypeScript scaffold builds, tests, formats, and reports
      its version without listening on a network port.
- [x] Fabric Java 21 scaffold builds a client-only JAR and has no Litematica or
      MaLiLib dependency. A graphical client launch is not claimed on this host.
- [x] Checksummed Gradle wrapper and npm lockfile are present.
- [x] Repository ignore, editor, license, and example environment files are
      reviewed.
- [x] Development scripts and top-level README describe the verified commands.

## Phase 1: protocol contracts

Completed:

- [x] Protocol 1.0 Envelope schema includes a nonce and required correlation
      fields with closed bounds.
- [x] Runtime-Paper handshake and agent request schemas are complete.
- [x] Tool call, tool result, and proposal schemas are complete.
- [x] Client handshake and fixed structured-view schemas are complete.
- [x] Recipe view and build preview schemas preserve structured semantics.
- [x] Capability manifest schema is declarative and closed.
- [x] Build-preview transfer metadata and chunks have bounded schema fields and
      separate reassembly/hash semantic validation.
- [x] Minimal valid and focused invalid fixtures cover every contract and local
      cross-schema reference.
- [x] Paper Java, Client Java, and Runtime TypeScript validate the same manifest
      entries and agree on results.
- [x] Semantic tests cover protocol mismatch, index-based chunk reassembly,
      byte limits, bounded gzip expansion, canonical base64, and SHA-256 checks.
- [x] View negotiation rejects a structured view when the client did not
      declare every required feature version.
- [x] Protocol documentation matches the final landed schemas, fixtures, and
      explicitly limited Phase 1 semantic implementation boundary.

## Phase 2: Runtime configuration and readiness

Completed:

- [x] Strict, versioned YAML configuration is capped at 64 KiB, rejects aliases,
      duplicate/unknown fields, unsafe paths, unsafe writable permissions, and
      dangerous secret combinations.
- [x] Environment substitution occurs after YAML parsing and only for complete
      `${NAME}` scalar values; missing API key and server token have stable errors.
- [x] Startup diagnostics contain stable codes and known field paths without
      serializing configuration values, provider exceptions, or unknown key names.
- [x] Log and SQLite state are confined below the configuration directory. New
      directories/files use `0700`/`0600`, and symlinks, hard-linked databases,
      broad state permissions, and root-directory state paths are rejected.
- [x] Runtime-owned SQLite readiness performs read, integrity, and real
      rollback-write probes through Node's built-in SQLite API, then retains one
      handle until shutdown. No migration or repository is implied.
- [x] Capability Schema loading and an abortable model-provider health interface
      are part of the fixed startup gate. Tests use a fake adapter; the default
      production adapter returns `PROVIDER_UNSUPPORTED` and never reports READY.
- [x] Fastify binds only after every injected core check passes. `/health` is
      loopback-only, cached, `no-store`, secret-free, and does not rerun checks.
- [x] Failed provider checks, occupied ports, and post-bind startup failures close
      the Fastify listener and SQLite handle without a transient READY state.
- [x] The packaged configuration template and top-level Bash/PowerShell launchers
      carry and forward explicit `--config` arguments.

## Phase 3: Paper self-check and conditional registration

Completed:

- [x] Runtime readiness now installs a loopback `/agent` WebSocket endpoint that
      accepts only the authenticated hello exchange. Strict UTF-8, duplicate
      keys, 16 KiB, Schema, time, identity, HMAC, and bounded replay checks run
      before a Paper connection occupies the single authenticated slot.
- [x] The shared HMAC transcript has real Paper and Runtime golden proofs that
      both TypeScript and JVM tests verify. Runtime echoes the Paper challenge;
      proof encoding is canonical unpadded base64url.
- [x] Paper configuration is strict and bounded, accepts only
      `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/agent`, resolves the token from a whole environment
      reference, checks Java/Minecraft compatibility, and rejects unsafe policy,
      paths, permissions, symlinks, state probes, and core descriptors.
- [x] Six closed, read-only, non-executable core descriptors satisfy the Phase 3
      readiness check. Typed tool adapters and invocation remain Phase 7.
- [x] Missing or invalid optional capability storage produces
      `OPTIONAL_CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE` and `DEGRADED` without blocking command
      registration. Capability Pack loading remains Phase 9.
- [x] `onEnable` returns without waiting for filesystem or network work. A
      generation guard closes late connections after disable and prevents stale
      or duplicate registration.
- [x] Successful authentication returns to the primary thread, preflights both
      command labels, verifies identity after public `CommandMap` registration,
      refreshes online-player command trees, and performs identity-only rollback
      and disable cleanup.
- [x] `/agent` and `/agent doctor` expose readiness and stable warning codes only.
      Runtime loss removes the command. Offline controls, requests, tools, and
      models are not part of this command surface.
- [x] Paper `1.21.11-132` smoke with the pinned SHA-256 proves authenticated
      registration, both labels, doctor degradation, and absence for unavailable,
      mismatched-token, and incompatible-protocol cases.

## Verification

Verified serially on 2026-07-12:

```bash
cd agent-runtime
npm run check
npm audit
npm audit --omit=dev

cd ..
./gradlew --no-daemon --max-workers=1 :paper-plugin:build
./gradlew --no-daemon --max-workers=1 :client-mod:build
./scripts/paper-smoke.sh
./scripts/package.sh
```

Results:

- Runtime: 8 Vitest files, 59 tests passed; TypeScript build, ESLint, and
  Prettier passed; full and production-only npm audits reported 0
  vulnerabilities.
- Paper: build and Spotless passed; 83 tests passed, including 38 shared dynamic
  Schema/HMAC cases plus strict local startup, real WebSocket fake-peer
  integration, lifecycle races, command-map transactions, doctor output, and
  descriptor tests.
- Fabric: remapped JAR build and Spotless passed; 39 tests passed, including the
  same 38 shared protocol cases plus client metadata.
- Both JVM reports contain no remote Schema load, `UnknownHostException`,
  invalid-schema error, skipped test, or failed test.
- Paper `1.21.11-132` JAR SHA-256
  `5ffef465eeeb5f2a3c23a24419d97c51afd7dbb4923ff42df9a3f58bba1ccfba`
  passed authenticated, unavailable, token-mismatch, and incompatible-protocol
  cases at `-Xms256M -Xmx512M`; both labels and doctor executed only in the
  authenticated case, and no Paper or Runtime process remained.
- Packaged Runtime preserved its compiled handshake endpoint, configuration
  template, and protocol schemas. The production CLI still fails closed at
  `PROVIDER_UNSUPPORTED` before binding because no production model provider
  adapter exists.
- All protocol JSON files parse successfully; Bash scripts pass `bash -n`.

PowerShell scripts were reviewed for native exit-code propagation but were not
executed because `pwsh` is unavailable on this Linux host. A graphical Fabric
client, a real online player during late command registration, and Litematica
were not started. Gradle reports Loom-originated deprecation warnings for future
Gradle 10 compatibility, but both builds pass on the locked Gradle 9.5.1
wrapper. Node emits its documented ExperimentalWarning when the built-in SQLite
module is loaded; it is not suppressed.

## Explicitly not implemented

- Production model-provider network health adapter or any model request.
- Runtime-Paper application messages, heartbeat, or reconnect. Phase 3 supports
  the authenticated hello only.
- Offline state persistence and `/agent on` or `/agent off`. The registered
  Phase 3 command exposes readiness and doctor only.
- SQLite migrations or repositories in either process; Phase 2 only owns the
  Runtime startup-readiness file and connection.
- Session resume, module routing, rate limiting, or cost accounting.
- Tool registry/execution, policy enforcement, proposals, confirmation, or
  audit persistence.
- Capability Pack discovery, approval, reload, or command execution.
- Client custom payload networking, overlay UI, item rendering, or preferences.
- Recipe, guide, locate, project, build, world mutation, or Litematica behavior.
- Full build-preview logical validation: strict single-member gzip framing,
  RFC 8785 content/Palette canonicalization, geometry, block count,
  base-region hash, and change-policy checks. These remain mandatory Phase 10
  gates before a preview network handler can be enabled.

The presence of a schema does not mark the corresponding feature implemented.

## Known design risks

### Provider boundary

Phase 2 proves the provider health interface and ordering with a fake adapter but
does not perform a production provider request. The CLI intentionally refuses
READY with `PROVIDER_UNSUPPORTED`; a fake provider cannot be selected through
configuration. A real adapter must map authentication, model availability,
unreachable, and timeout failures without logging request or response bodies.

### Node SQLite stability

Node 22's built-in synchronous SQLite API avoids a native addon on this small
host, but Node still labels it active development and emits an ExperimentalWarning.
Phase 2 confines it to bounded startup work. The repository layer must reassess
the driver before adding request-path database operations.

### Conditional command registration

ADR 0001 selects public late `CommandMap` registration and the exact Paper smoke
proves both labels and conditional absence. An initial failure deliberately has
no in-process recovery path and requires restart. Unit tests prove that
`Player#updateCommands()` is invoked, but a real connected client was not part
of the smoke; observing its refreshed Brigadier tree remains a later integration
test gap.

### Litematica compatibility

Litematica and MaLiLib internals are exact-version sensitive. A future adapter
must lock both versions and prove optional class loading, preview lifecycle, and
native Material List HUD integration. No compatibility is assumed now.

### Large world writes

A preflight region hash does not make a multi-tick update atomic. The first
write implementation must use conservative limits and define conflict and
partial-failure behavior before raising block limits.

### Third-party command parsing

Paper plugins do not universally expose a side-effect-free Brigadier validation
path. A command-backed Capability remains disabled unless complete preflight
parsing is demonstrated for the locked plugin version; otherwise use a typed
adapter.

## Next gates

1. Implement Phase 4 desired mode, persistent Offline state, `/agent off`, and
   `/agent on` without weakening the initial conditional-registration gate.
2. Define authenticated-connection loss and explicit recheck behavior before
   adding reconnect or heartbeat messages.
3. Preserve the Phase 2 startup gate when the production provider health adapter
   is introduced for the first model-backed phase.
4. Add Gradle dependency-verification metadata before calling a release
   byte-for-byte reproducible; Paper 1.21.11 is available only through an
   upstream mutable snapshot coordinate.
